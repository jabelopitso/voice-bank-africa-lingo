How VoiceBank Africa Works

Voice Commands: Users can click a button to start listening and speak commands like:

Provides visual indicators (e.g., spinners) while processing commands.

Uses speech synthesis to give audio feedback confirming actions.

Multilingual Support: The app automatically adapts voice recognition and text feedback based on the selected language (Zulu or Sotho).
